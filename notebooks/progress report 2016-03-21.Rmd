##Project Overview
I'm building a model to predict a student's performance in an online course from his/her level of engagement in the class. The ultimate goal is to determine which engagement activities contribute most to student performance and understanding. I'm using a data set from NYU Langone from MedU, an online learning platform for medical courses.



##About the Data
Student performance is measured by score on multiple-choice questions throughout the 23-card unit.  
See a screenshot of a sample card below.

![Screenshot of sample learning card](../figures/card_screenshot.png)

Variables that may have an impact on student performance:

  * Clicking hyperlinks
  * Enlarging images
  * Checking answers
  * Time spent on cards
  
```{r cache=FALSE}
library(knitr)
source('../scripts/explore_data.R')
df = load_data()

source('../scripts/processing.R')
outdf = restructure(df)
outdf = rename_cols(outdf,new_names)
data = train_test_split(outdf)
train=data[[1]]
test=data[[2]]
kable(head(outdf))
hist(outdf$success)
```

##First Models
```{r echo=FALSE}
source('../scripts/models.R')
```

###Logistic
There appears to be a strong relationship between performance and clicks on the magnify button and expert buttons.  But the relationship is less clear with handling time and hyperlink clicks. 
```{r}
mylogit <- glm(label ~ hyperlink_clicks + magnify_clicks + expert_clicks + handling_time, data = train, family = "binomial")
summary(mylogit)
```

However, the model still needs a lot of work. It does not appear very accurate.

Train Accuracy:
```{r echo=FALSE}
train_tab = confusion_matrix(mylogit,train)
print(train_tab)
accuracy = get_accuracy(train_tab)
print(c("accuracy:",accuracy))
```

Test Accuracy:
```{r echo=FALSE}
tab = confusion_matrix(mylogit,test)
print(tab)
accuracy = get_accuracy(tab)
print(c("accuracy:",accuracy))
```

###Decision Tree
Next I tried a decision tree, borrowing code from the classification tutorial:
```{r}
mydat_tree <- ctree(label ~ hyperlink_clicks + magnify_clicks + expert_clicks + handling_time, data = train)
plot(mydat_tree)
```

Train Accuracy:
```{r echo=FALSE}
tab = confusion_matrix(mydat_tree,train)
print(tab)
accuracy = get_accuracy(tab)
print(c("accuracy:",accuracy))
```

Test Accuracy:
```{r echo=FALSE}
tab = confusion_matrix(mydat_tree,test)
print(tab)
accuracy = get_accuracy(tab)
print(c("accuracy:",accuracy))
```

##Next Steps
There is still a lot of work to do. I will tweak the logistic classifier, trying out different variables and variations on the existing variables.  

The tree classifier shows more promise. 

I also want to visualize the results better
